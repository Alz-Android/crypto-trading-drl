# Solana DRL Trading System - Setup Complete!

## ✅ Steps 1 & 2 Complete

**Created Files:**
1. `train_solana_agent.py` - Main training script (18.5KB)
2. `backtest_solana_agent.py` - Backtesting script (13.0KB)  
3. `test_system.py` - System verification script (3.3KB)

## 🧪 System Test Results

✅ All dependencies working (PyTorch 2.8.0+cpu, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
✅ SOL 6-year data accessible (1,994 days: 2020-04-10 to 2025-09-24)
✅ All components imported successfully (TechnicalIndicators, CryptoTradingEnv, PPOAgent)
⚠️ GPU not available - will use CPU (training will be slower but functional)

## 📊 Training Configuration

- **Data**: 6 years of Solana daily OHLCV data
- **Split**: 80% training (2020-2024) / 20% validation (2024-2025)
- **Algorithm**: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- **Network**: CNN-LSTM with Actor-Critic architecture
- **Episodes**: 1,000 total
- **Features**: Close price, RSI, ATR, OBV technical indicators
- **Actions**: Buy(1), Hold(0), Sell(2)
- **Initial Balance**: $10,000

## 🚀 Ready for Step 3: Training

**To start training, run:**
```bash
cd crypto-trading-drl
python train_solana_agent.py
```

**Expected Training Time:** 2-4 hours (CPU) or 30-60 minutes (GPU)

**Training will:**
- Create `training_results/` directory
- Save models every 50 episodes
- Save best model based on validation performance
- Generate training progress plots
- Log detailed metrics

**After training, run backtesting:**
```bash
python backtest_solana_agent.py
```

## 📈 What to Expect

The system will learn to:
- Analyze 100-day price patterns using CNN layers
- Capture temporal dependencies with LSTM networks  
- Make trading decisions (Buy/Hold/Sell) based on technical indicators
- Optimize for maximum portfolio returns using reinforcement learning

**Success Metrics:**
- Positive validation rewards
- Outperforming buy-and-hold strategy
- Consistent trading patterns
- Profitable returns on backtesting

## 🎯 Ready to Start!

All systems are go! You can now proceed with Step 3 training whenever you're ready.
