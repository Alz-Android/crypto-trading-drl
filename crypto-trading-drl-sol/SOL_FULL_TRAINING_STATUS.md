- [ ] Performance comparison vs buy-and-hold
- [ ] Trading behavior analysis
- [ ] Visualization generation

## 🎯 **Expected Improvements Over Fast Training**

### 📈 **Performance Expectations**
- **Better Market Timing**: 5x more episodes for pattern learning
- **Improved Risk Management**: Full lookback window for context
- **Stable Trading Behavior**: More training data reduces overfitting
- **Higher Returns**: Better optimization with comprehensive dataset

### 🎨 **Technical Improvements**
- **Pattern Recognition**: CNN layers learn price patterns from 6 years
- **Temporal Dependencies**: LSTM captures long-term market cycles
- **Feature Learning**: Full technical indicator relationships
- **Robustness**: Training across different market regimes

## 📊 **Fast Training Results (Baseline)**

From our previous fast training:
- **Final Return**: -19.26% (validation period)
- **Buy-Hold Return**: +45.66% (validation period)
- **Trading Behavior**: Very conservative (97.7% holding)
- **Issue**: Underperformed due to limited training

## 🎯 **Full Training Goals**

1. **Beat Buy-and-Hold**: Target positive outperformance vs baseline
2. **Active Trading**: More balanced buy/hold/sell decisions
3. **Consistent Performance**: Stable returns across different periods
4. **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Better risk management with full context
